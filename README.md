# Solving N-Queens with Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms take a very different approach to artificial intelligence. Rather than deriving answers from data, these algorithms mimic the rules of evolution instead.  The solutions found by these algorithms do not result from a rigorous mathematical formula, but rather, the laws of nature, and a whole lot of trial and error.

Edit the settings in class_EimWorld.py to run you own simulations, and use the visualization files to graph the resulting pickle files.
